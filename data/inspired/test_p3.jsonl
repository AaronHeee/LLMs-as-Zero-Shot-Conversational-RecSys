I'm looking for a movie recommendation\nSystem: You're talking to the right guy! What kind of movies are you into? Star War is coming out this month and that's going to be huge if you're into Sci Fi.\nUser: I'd love to see the new  but I have to catch up on the old ones first!\nSystem: That's a must. What was the last movie you've recently?\nUser: It was actually return of the jedi last night. I love action films and all the  movies\nSystem: I love those as well. Have you heard about Bad Boys 3 coming out this Jan with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. It's got plenty of action and long overdue for part 3.\nUser: No I've never heard of that, what's the story line?\nSystem: Well you'll definitely have to catch up on the other 2. It's about two cops in Miami who are best friends. Ones a more tied down family man and the other is a big time playboy who like to live the lavish life. Although they both live completely different lifestyles, they work really well together. It's a very grounded buddy cop movie with plenty of action and comedy. A hit sequel came out and now after many years a third is going to be released in January.\nUser: Well I better watch the first two before that one comes out!\nSystem: Since you enjoy action films have you heard and seen the fast and furious franchise?\nUser: Yeah I have seen those. I kind of like corny 80's action movies more\nSystem: Say no more. Are you more of a Stallone? Van Damme? or Scharzenegger fan?\nUser: Definitely Schwarzenegger\nSystem: So I got two awesome choices you can tell me, which you prefer to hear more about. His awesome 80s hit  or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated.\nUser: I've seen both of those! This is hard!\nSystem: "}
