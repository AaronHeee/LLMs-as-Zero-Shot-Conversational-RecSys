See any good movies lately?\nSystem: Yes, I've seen some great ones. What about you?\nUser: I've seen a few that I really liked. What kind of movies are you into? I'm a horror and comedy fan myself.\nSystem: I love horror and comedy. I also like action, and recently I have really enjoyed documentaries. Which horror movie is your favorite?\nUser: That's a tough one. Honestly I'm a huge fan of earlier horror. I like the new stuff but Nightmare on Elm Street, What Lies Beneath and What We Do in the Shadows.. That era will always be my favorite. See any good ones recently? I've been looking for more modern horror.\nSystem: I really like those too. I agree that the new ones aren't bad, but nothing beats the classics. Wow, that makes me think of a couple that you'd probably be interested in because of what you said. Do you like sequels at all?\nUser: Oh heck yeah. I would argue that Nightmare on Elm Street 3 was the best of the whole bunch. And the remake for IT was downright terrifying.\nSystem: I know. I also liked the Interstellar series. I thought that some of the ones from the 80s were actually better than ones in the 70s. Do you recall who wrote the nightmare on Elm street movies because that'd help me make a recommendation. I think that made a movie recently you'd be interested in\nUser: It was Wes Craven. Love that guys work. Sure they were a little campy but It was the way of things at the time.\nSystem: Have you ever heard of Stephen King? Haha, you said you like horror so that might be a silly question. I forgot about his movies but those were some of my favorites growing up. If you like him, I actually have some really good recommendations.\nUser: Bruh. Stephen King is like my favorite author of all time after Orwell.\nSystem: Hahaha that's crazy. I love Stephen King, and I love Orwell's 1984. That's crazy. I also think they did a decent job of turning King's books into movies. Which movies based on his books have you seen? I'll know which one to not recommend based on that.\nUser: 1984 is my exact favorite book actually... As for the King movies IT (Both the 90's one and the remake), Fright Night (I think that was him), Pet Cemetery one and two (From back in the day)... Gosh it's been awhile. The Spy Who Dumped Me. There were a few others but they were all years ago. Fun fact: He used to due the Stan Lee thing where he stuck himself into the movies as a cameo.\nSystem: That's crazy. 1984 stuck with me for a long time and influenced me a lot. And that is a good fun fact about King hahaha. Now i'm going to have to look that up. Have you ever watched The Year Without a Santa Claus?\nUser: *Facepalm* How do I forget Die Hard!? I've seen the one with Spaceballs Nickolson in it. Was there a new one? I cause I would watch that in a heartbeat.\nSystem: Yes, you have to check out Lost in Space. I watched that in 2019 and it's great. It's Guilty by Suspicion All grown up.\nUser: WHAT? Yes. I absolutely have to go and watch that. Stephen, you tricky monkey. Couldn't just name it 'Shining 2' could he? I'm definitely going to have to watch that.\nSystem: ", "resp": {"id": "chatcmpl-7BzABJVMkDCZEG0N8rm0nzxJ0GGnZ", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1683091075, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 824, "completion_tokens": 123, "total_tokens": 947}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

Based on the conversation, you reply me with 20 recommendations without extra sentences.\n Here is the conversation: \nSystem: Hello there! How are you doing this morning?\nUser: Okay. I'm kinda bored, though... Part of me wants to go watch a movie. Got any recommendations?\nSystem: For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw?\nUser: My tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer stuff with a decent amount of action or a good sense of humor. Not outright comedies, just funny movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was The Shining a couple months back. That was pretty funny.\nSystem: I absolutely loved Jurassic Park. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Epic film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself.\nUser: Sleepy Hollow was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And True films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind.\nUser: I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it...
