I appreciate the help. I want to find a good movie to take my girlfriend to this weekend.\nSystem: What was the last movie you two saw together, did she enjoy it?\nUser: The last movie we saw together was Star Wars Rise of Skywalker which she enjoyed but admittedly, we saw it for me. She enjoys comedies more than action.\nSystem: Haha, ok. Are you looking for more of a general comedy film or something perhaps more romantic?\nUser: I'd be willing to go with either or one that's both. I'm just not sure what's out there in those categories.\nSystem: Is there an actor or actress in particular that you know she likes?\nUser: She likes Ryan Reynolds. The Deadpool guy. She even says I look a little him. I don't see it. Maybe like his older brother. She loved him and Sandra Bullock in Zombies 2.\nSystem: Alright, let me see what I can find!\nUser: Thanks for the help. I appreciate it very much. I'm looking forward to spending time together and treating her to a good movie.\nSystem: How do you feel about A Dog's Journey? It's a mix of goofy comedy and action with the likes of Kevin Heart, Jack Black, and Dwayne Johnson.\nUser: That has potential. Isn't Dwayne Johnson The Rock?\nSystem: Yup, I think he dropped the moniker awhile back when he got serious about acting.\nUser: Right. That does look good and I'll make that first on my list. But do have one more recommendation for me as a back-up plan?\nSystem: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and Shaun of the Dead.\nUser: I'll take a look at both of those. If we do decide to stay home, is there a romantic comedy that you recommend?\nSystem: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Tell with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested.\nUser: The classics are always a nice switch. Tell me about it!\nSystem: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved.\nUser: Awww. That actually sounds perfect! Even if we see something in the theater, I'm definitely taking this recommendation. Thank you so much for your help!\nSystem:  ASSISTANT:", "resp": {"id": "dummy", "object": "dummy", "created": "dummy", "model": "../../../llms/vicuna_13b", "usage": "dummy", "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": " 1.

Based on the conversation, you reply me with 20 recommendations without extra sentences.\n Here is the conversation: \nSystem: Hello there! How are you doing this morning?\nUser: Okay. I'm kinda bored, though... Part of me wants to go watch a movie. Got any recommendations?\nSystem: For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw?\nUser: My tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer stuff with a decent amount of action or a good sense of humor. Not outright comedies, just funny movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was The Shining a couple months back. That was pretty funny.\nSystem: I absolutely loved Jurassic Park. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Epic film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself.\nUser: Sleepy Hollow was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And True films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together...\nSystem: I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind.\nUser: I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it... What're the other two like?\nSystem:  ASSISTANT:", "resp": {"id": "dummy", "object": "dummy", "created": "dummy", "model": "../../../llms/vicuna_13b", "usage": "dummy", "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": " 1.
