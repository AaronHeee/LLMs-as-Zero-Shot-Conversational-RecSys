I agree that the new ones aren't bad, but nothing beats the classics. Wow, that makes me think of a couple that you'd probably be interested in because of what you said. Do you like sequels at all?\nUser: Oh heck yeah. I would argue that Nightmare on Elm Street 3 was the best of the whole bunch. And the remake for IT was downright terrifying.\nSystem: I know. I also liked the  series. I thought that some of the ones from the 80s were actually better than ones in the 70s. Do you recall who wrote the nightmare on Elm street movies because that'd help me make a recommendation. I think that made a movie recently you'd be interested in\nUser: It was Wes Craven. Love that guys work. Sure they were a little campy but It was the way of things at the time.\nSystem: Have you ever heard of Stephen King? Haha, you said you like horror so that might be a silly question. I forgot about his movies but those were some of my favorites growing up. If you like him, I actually have some really good recommendations.\nUser: Bruh. Stephen King is like my favorite author of all time after Orwell.\nSystem: Hahaha that's crazy. I love Stephen King, and I love Orwell's 1984. That's crazy. I also think they did a decent job of turning King's books into movies. Which movies based on his books have you seen? I'll know which one to not recommend based on that.\nUser: 1984 is my exact favorite book actually... As for the King movies IT (Both the 90's one and the remake),  (I think that was him), Pet Cemetery one and two (From back in the day)... Gosh it's been awhile. . There were a few others but they were all years ago. Fun fact: He used to due the Stan Lee thing where he stuck himself into the movies as a cameo.\nSystem: That's crazy. 1984 stuck with me for a long time and influenced me a lot. And that is a good fun fact about King hahaha. Now i'm going to have to look that up. Have you ever watched ?\nUser: *Facepalm* How do I forget !? I've seen the one with  Nickolson in it. Was there a new one? I cause I would watch that in a heartbeat.\nSystem: Yes, you have to check out . I watched that in 2019 and it's great. It's  All grown up.\nUser: WHAT? Yes. I absolutely have to go and watch that. Stephen, you tricky monkey. Couldn't just name it 'Shining 2' could he? I'm definitely going to have to watch that.\nSystem: ", "resp": {"id": "chatcmpl-7JxaCIi6ZxHpZecK9X7fkDObnfCBz", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1684991624, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 790, "completion_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 970}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

I know I've heard the title but who was in it escapes me.\nUser: It is a comedy. About kids doing some innapropriate things\nSystem: Ah. So kind of like funny teenage movies like Super Bad? Do you like any action films or horror?\nUser: It is like that movie. Same director. I love horror movies as well. the scarier the better. Do you have any recomendations for those?\nSystem: I LOVE horror movies. They are my absolute favorite. I can recommend older scary movies. New ones don't seem to be as scary. I like supernatural horror. I think Fantasy island is supposed to be scary. Have you seen that one yet?\nUser: I have not seen that one yet but I want too. I agree that many horror movies today are not scary. i watch some foreign ones these days. They seem to do more scary things.\nSystem: They do. I do like the Conjuring films and there is another one coming out this year. Not a spin-off like  but an actual Conjuring movie. Can't wait.\nUser: I like those as well. i am in the mood for an older scary movie. What would you recommend?\nSystem: The Changling with George C. Scott, not Angelina Jolie. , Woman in Black was scary too. A British film called  with Aidan Quinn is quite good as well. Hard to find.\nUser: I think I will watch Woman in Black today.

All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And  films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately.
