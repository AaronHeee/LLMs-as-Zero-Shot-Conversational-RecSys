Based on the conversation, you reply me with 20 recommendations without extra sentences.\n Here is the conversation: \nSystem: Hi! How are you doing today?\nUser: I'm doing pretty great! See any good movies lately?\nSystem: Yes, I've seen some great ones. What about you?\nUser: I've seen a few that I really liked. What kind of movies are you into? I'm a horror and comedy fan myself.\nSystem: I love horror and comedy. I also like action, and recently I have really enjoyed documentaries. Which horror movie is your favorite?\nUser: That's a tough one. Honestly I'm a huge fan of earlier horror. I like the new stuff but Nightmare on Elm Street, Wishmaster and Hellraiser.. That era will always be my favorite. See any good ones recently? I've been looking for more modern horror.\nSystem: I really like those too. I agree that the new ones aren't bad, but nothing beats the classics. Wow, that makes me think of a couple that you'd probably be interested in because of what you said. Do you like sequels at all?\nUser: Oh heck yeah. I would argue that Nightmare on Elm Street 3 was the best of the whole bunch. And the remake for IT was downright terrifying.\nSystem: I know. I also liked the Halloween series. I thought that some of the ones from the 80s were actually better than ones in the 70s. Do you recall who wrote the nightmare on Elm street movies because that'd help me make a recommendation. I think that made a movie recently you'd be interested in\nUser: It was Wes Craven. Love that guys work. Sure they were a little campy but It was the way of things at the time.\nSystem: Have you ever heard of Stephen King? Haha, you said you like horror so that might be a silly question. I forgot about his movies but those were some of my favorites growing up. If you like him, I actually have some really good recommendations.\nUser: Bruh. Stephen King is like my favorite author of all time after Orwell.\nSystem: Hahaha that's crazy. I love Stephen King, and I love Orwell's 1984. That's crazy. I also think they did a decent job of turning King's books into movies. Which movies based on his books have you seen? I'll know which one to not recommend based on that.\nUser: 1984 is my exact favorite book actually... As for the King movies IT (Both the 90's one and the remake), Cat's Eye (I think that was him), Pet Cemetery one and two (From back in the day)... Gosh it's been awhile. Gerald's Game. There were a few others but they were all years ago. Fun fact: He used to due the Stan Lee thing where he stuck himself into the movies as a cameo.\nSystem: That's crazy. 1984 stuck with me for a long time and influenced me a lot. And that is a good fun fact about King hahaha. Now i'm going to have to look that up. Have you ever watched The Shining?\nUser: *Facepalm* How do I forget The Shining!? I've seen the one with Jack Nickolson in it. Was there a new one? I cause I would watch that in a heartbeat.\nSystem: Yes, you have to check out Doctor Sleep. I watched that in 2019 and it's great. It's Danny All grown up.\nUser: WHAT? Yes. I absolutely have to go and watch that. Stephen, you tricky monkey. Couldn't just name it 'Shining 2' could he? I'm definitely going to have to watch that.\nSystem: ", "resp": {"id": "chatcmpl-7BliXw6BHKl5J2htmRmCLfAyNo3fz", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1683039389, "model": "gpt-4-0314", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 806, "completion_tokens": 116, "total_tokens": 922}, "choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

Based on the conversation, you reply me with 20 recommendations without extra sentences.\n Here is the conversation: \nSystem: Hello, I'm here to help find you a movie trailer!\nUser: Excellent. I appreciate the help. I want to find a good movie to take my girlfriend to this weekend.\nSystem: What was the last movie you two saw together, did she enjoy it?\nUser: The last movie we saw together was Star Wars Rise of Skywalker which she enjoyed but admittedly, we saw it for me. She enjoys comedies more than action.\nSystem: Haha, ok. Are you looking for more of a general comedy film or something perhaps more romantic?\nUser: I'd be willing to go with either or one that's both. I'm just not sure what's out there in those categories.\nSystem: Is there an actor or actress in particular that you know she likes?\nUser: She likes Ryan Reynolds. The Deadpool guy. She even says I look a little him. I don't see it. Maybe like his older brother. She loved him and Sandra Bullock in The Proposal.\nSystem: Alright, let me see what I can find!\nUser: Thanks for the help. I appreciate it very much. I'm looking forward to spending time together and treating her to a good movie.\nSystem: How do you feel about Jumanji: The Next Level? It's a mix of goofy comedy and action with the likes of Kevin Heart, Jack Black, and Dwayne Johnson.\nUser: That has potential. Isn't Dwayne Johnson The Rock?\nSystem: Yup, I think he dropped the moniker awhile back when he got serious about acting.\nUser: Right. That does look good and I'll make that first on my list. But do have one more recommendation for me as a back-up plan?\nSystem: Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and Bad Boys for Life.\nUser: I'll take a look at both of those. If we do decide to stay home, is there a romantic comedy that you recommend?\nSystem: If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested.\nUser: The classics are always a nice switch. Tell me about it!\nSystem: Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved.\nUser: Awww. That actually sounds perfect! Even if we see something in the theater, I'm definitely taking this recommendation.

All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror.
